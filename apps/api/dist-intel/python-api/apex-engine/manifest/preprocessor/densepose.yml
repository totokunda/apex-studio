category: Face and Pose
class: DenseposeDetector
description: Maps all human pixels in an image to a 3D surface model of the body.
  Provides dense correspondence between 2D image pixels and 3D body surface, enabling
  detailed body shape understanding. Excellent for human body analysis, pose transfer,
  and avatar creation.
module: src.preprocess.densepose

parameters:
- default: 512
  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.

- default: INTER_CUBIC
  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.
