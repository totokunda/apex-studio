description: Holistically-Nested Edge Detection using deep learning to identify object
  boundaries and meaningful edges. Produces thicker, more object-aware edges than
  traditional methods. Great for converting photos to sketch-like representations
  and understanding scene structure.

- default: 512
  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.

  description: When enabled, applies additional filtering to remove noise and produce
    cleaner edge detection results. Recommended for images with complex backgrounds.

    drawing with simplified, artistic lines instead of precise edges.

    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.
