category: Depth and Normal
class: NormalBaeDetector
description: Boundary-Aware Estimator for accurate surface normal prediction from
  single images. Produces high-quality normal maps with precise boundaries and fine
  geometric details. Particularly effective for objects with complex surface variations.
  Useful for relighting, material editing, and 3D reconstruction pipelines.
