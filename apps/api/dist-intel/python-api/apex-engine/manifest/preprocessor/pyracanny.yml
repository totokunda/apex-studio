category: Line
class: PyraCannyDetector
description: Multi-scale Canny edge detection using image pyramids to capture edges
  at different scales. Detects both fine details and large-scale structures in a single
  pass. More comprehensive than standard Canny for images with features at multiple
  scales. Great for complex scenes with varied detail levels.
module: src.preprocess.pyracanny
name: Pyramid Canny
parameters:
- default: 100
  description: The lower threshold for the multi-scale Canny edge detector. Edges
    with gradient values below this are discarded. Lower values detect more edges
    at multiple scales.
  display_name: Low Threshold
  max: 500
  min: 0
  name: low_threshold
  type: int
- default: 200
  description: The upper threshold for the multi-scale Canny edge detector. Edges
    with gradient values above this are kept as strong edges at all scales. Higher
    values detect only the most prominent edges.
  display_name: High Threshold
  max: 500
  min: 0
  name: high_threshold
  type: int
- default: 512
  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.

- default: INTER_CUBIC
  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.
