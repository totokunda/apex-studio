  description: Example showing how to exclude Hopper GPUs from running a model

spec:
  engine: example
  model_type: example
  
  # Compute requirements with architecture exclusions
  compute_requirements:
    # Require at least Turing generation
    min_cuda_compute_capability: 7.5
    
    # Support CUDA and CPU
    supported_compute_types:
    - cuda
    - cpu
    
    # Exclude Hopper architecture due to known issues
    excluded_cuda_architectures:
    - sm_90  # H100, H800
    
    # Note: You could also use allowed_cuda_architectures instead:
    # allowed_cuda_architectures:
    # - sm_75  # Turing: RTX 2080, RTX 2080 Ti
    # - sm_80  # Ampere: A100
    # - sm_86  # Ampere: RTX 3090, RTX 3080
    # - sm_89  # Ada Lovelace: RTX 4090, L4, L40
