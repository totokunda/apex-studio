category: Line
class: CannyDetector
description: Classic multi-stage edge detection algorithm developed by John Canny.
  Uses gradient analysis to identify edges with precise localization and minimal false
  positives. Ideal for detecting clear, well-defined edges in photos and architectural
  images.
module: src.preprocess.canny
name: Canny Edge Detection
parameters:
- default: 100
  description: The lower threshold for the Canny edge detector. Edges with gradient
    values below this threshold are discarded. Lower values detect more edges including
    weak ones.
  display_name: Low Threshold
  max: 500
  min: 0
  name: low_threshold
  type: int
- default: 200
  description: The upper threshold for the Canny edge detector. Edges with gradient
    values above this threshold are kept as strong edges. Higher values detect only
    the most prominent edges.
  display_name: High Threshold
  max: 500
  min: 0
  name: high_threshold
  type: int
- default: 512
  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.

- default: INTER_CUBIC
  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.
