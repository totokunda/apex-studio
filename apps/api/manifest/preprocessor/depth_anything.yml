category: Depth and Normal
class: DepthAnythingDetector
description: State-of-the-art monocular depth estimation that works reliably across
  diverse scenes and conditions. Trained on massive datasets to handle any image type
  from indoor scenes to outdoor landscapes. Produces accurate relative depth maps
  showing distance from camera.
