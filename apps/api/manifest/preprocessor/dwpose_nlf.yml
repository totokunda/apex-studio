category: Face and Pose
class: DwposeNlfDetector
description: Comprehensive whole-body pose estimation capturing body, hands, and facial
  keypoints in a single unified model. Fast and accurate for real-time applications.
  Ideal for animation reference, motion analysis, and character pose extraction with
  granular control over which components to detect, with additional non-linear filtering and resizing.
module: src.preprocess.dwpose_nlf
name: DWPoseNLF
parameters:
- default: 512
  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.

  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.
