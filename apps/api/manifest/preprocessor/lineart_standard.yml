category: Line
class: LineartStandardDetector
description: General-purpose line art extraction with Gaussian smoothing for balanced
  results across different image types. Adjustable sigma parameter allows fine control
  over line smoothness. Versatile option for realistic photos, illustrations, and
  mixed content.

- default: 512
  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.

  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.

  description: The standard deviation of the Gaussian blur kernel applied during line
    extraction. Higher values create smoother, softer lines while lower values preserve
    more detail and sharpness.
