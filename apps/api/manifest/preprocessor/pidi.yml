class: PidiNetDetector
description: Pixel Difference Network for high-quality edge detection with minimal
  parameters. Efficient and accurate edge detector that works well across various
  image types. Offers safe mode and scribble output options. Good balance between
  quality and computational efficiency for edge-based applications.
module: src.preprocess.pidi
name: PiDiNet Edge Detection
parameters:
- default: 512
  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.

- default: false
  description: When enabled, applies post-processing to reduce noise and produce cleaner
    edge maps. Recommended for complex or noisy images.
  display_name: Safe Mode
  name: safe
  type: bool
- default: false
  description: When enabled, converts edges to a scribble-style artistic representation
    with simplified, sketch-like lines.
  display_name: Scribble Style
  name: scribble
  type: bool
- default: false
  description: When enabled, applies additional filtering to refine edge detection
    and remove artifacts. Can improve edge quality but may reduce detail.
  display_name: Apply Filter
  name: apply_filter
  type: bool
- default: INTER_CUBIC
  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.
