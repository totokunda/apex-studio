category: Face and Pose
class: Pose2dDetector
description: >
  2D pose preprocessor that can either crop a high-quality face region or render a
  clean pose-conditioning map from an input image. Uses a ViTPose whole-body ONNX
  model for keypoint prediction and an optional YOLOv10 detector for robust person
  localization, making it well suited for animation, talking-head, and avatar setups.
module: src.preprocess.pose2d
name: Pose2D
parameters:
  - default:
      - 480
      - 832
    description: >
      Target spatial resolution (height, width) the input image is resized to before
      pose extraction. Standard is a good balance of speed and detail; High Definition
      preserves more fine structure at higher compute cost.

      - name: Standard

  - default: INTER_CUBIC
    description: >
      Interpolation method used when resizing images to the target size. Cubic and
      Lanczos give smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor and Linear are faster
      and can preserve sharper edges.
