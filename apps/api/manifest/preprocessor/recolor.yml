category: Color
class: Recolorizer
description: Converts images to grayscale while preserving brightness structure using
  luminance or intensity calculation. Offers gamma correction for brightness adjustment.
  Useful for preparing images for colorization, creating base layers for artistic
  effects, or analyzing tonal distribution without color distraction.
module: src.preprocess.recolor
name: Recolor
parameters:
- default: luminance
  description: The method for calculating brightness values. 'Luminance' uses perceptually
    accurate weights for RGB channels. 'Intensity' uses simple averaging of RGB values.

  options:
  - name: Luminance
    value: luminance
  - name: Intensity
    value: intensity
  type: category
- default: 1.0
  description: The gamma correction factor applied to the recolored output. Values
    below 1.0 brighten the image, values above 1.0 darken it. 1.0 applies no correction.

  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.
