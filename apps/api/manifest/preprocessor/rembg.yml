category: Background Removal
class: RembgDetector
description: Automatically removes backgrounds from images and videos using advanced
  segmentation. Accurately separates subjects from backgrounds with optional alpha
  matting for fine details like hair and fur. Supports post-processing for cleaner
  masks. Perfect for product photography, portraits, green screen replacement, and
  compositing.

parameters:
- default: 512
  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.

  type: category
- default: INTER_CUBIC
  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.

  type: category
- default: false
  description: When enabled, applies alpha matting for refined edge detection and
    smoother transparency transitions. Particularly useful for subjects with fine
    details like hair. Requires more processing time.
  display_name: Alpha Matting
  name: alpha_matting
  type: bool
- default: 240
  description: The threshold value (0-255) for classifying pixels as definite foreground
    during alpha matting. Higher values are more conservative, classifying fewer pixels
    as foreground.

  description: The threshold value (0-255) for classifying pixels as definite background
    during alpha matting. Lower values are more conservative, classifying fewer pixels
    as background.

  min: 0
  name: alpha_matting_background_threshold
  type: int

  description: The erosion kernel size in pixels for alpha matting preprocessing.
    Larger values create a wider transition zone between foreground and background,
    resulting in smoother edges.

  description: When enabled, applies morphological operations to clean up the segmentation
    mask by removing small artifacts and smoothing boundaries.
