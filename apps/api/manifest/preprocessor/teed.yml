class: TEDDetector
description: Tiny and Efficient Edge Detector designed for speed without sacrificing
  quality. Lightweight neural network optimized for real-time edge detection. Iterative
  refinement with safe steps produces progressively cleaner edges. Excellent for mobile
  devices, video processing, and applications requiring fast edge detection.

  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.

  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.

  description: The number of refinement iterations applied during edge detection.
    More steps produce cleaner, more refined edges with reduced noise, but increase
    processing time. Typical range is 1-5 steps.
