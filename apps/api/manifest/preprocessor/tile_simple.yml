category: Color
class: TTPLanet_Tile_Detector_Simple
description: Straightforward tile effect using downscaling and Gaussian blur. Simple
  approach for creating blocky, posterized color effects. Fast processing with basic
  color simplification. Good for quick stylization, reducing image complexity, and
  creating retro pixel-art inspired looks.
module: src.preprocess.tile
name: Tile Simple
parameters:
- default: 2.0
  description: The downscaling factor for image reduction. Higher values create more
    aggressive downsampling. A value of 2.0 reduces width and height by half. Useful
    for creating simplified, blocky tile effects.

  type: float
- default: 1.0
  description: The intensity of Gaussian blur applied to the image. Higher values
    create stronger blur and smoother transitions between colors. 1.0 is the standard
    blur strength.
