The senior frog instructor sits cross-legged at the center, eyes closed, voice deep and calm. 'We are one with the pond.' All the frogs answer softly: 'Ommm...' 'We are one with the mud.' 'Ommm...' He smiles faintly. 'We are one with the flies.' A quiet pause. The camera slowly pans to the side — one frog twitches, eyes darting. Suddenly — *thwip!* — its tongue snaps out, catching a fly mid-air and pulling it into its mouth. The master exhales slowly, still serene. 'But we do not chase the flies…' Beat. '…not during class.' The guilty frog freezes, then lowers its head in visible shame, folding its hands back into the meditative pose. The other frogs resume their chant: 'Ommm...' Camera holds for a moment on the embarrassed frog, eyes closed too tightly, pretending nothing happened.",
